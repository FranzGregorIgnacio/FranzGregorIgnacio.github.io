            Hello! My name is Franz Gregor Ignacio, a professional with ACE and BSIS Guard certifications and a
            focused career trajectory toward roles such as Security Analyst, Network Engineer, or Red Team Penetration
            Tester. I am deeply committed to the protection and integrity of digital infrastructure, drawing from a
            strong foundation in physical security and a methodical, detail-oriented mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            My career to date includes direct experience in security operations, where I cultivated skills in threat
            assessment, incident response, and situational awareness in high-stakes environments. These capabilities,
            combined with my academic background and technical projects which includes a developed Python-based game
            and a computer graphics visualization built using OpenGL and C++—demonstrate my readiness to navigate and
            contribute to the evolving cybersecurity landscape through industry standard practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to my technical credentials, I have held leadership roles, including serving as the president of
            the Chess Club, which fostered my ability to think strategically and manage complex challenges. Outside of
            professional pursuits, I am an avid gamer and creative writer, actively developing a game that merges
            narrative design, gameplay mechanics, and modular system architecture.
          </p>

          <p>
            This portfolio showcases selected projects that reflect both my technical proficiency and creative
            aspirations. I invite you to explore the work presented here and welcome opportunities for collaboration,
            mentorship, or professional engagement within the cybersecurity field.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
      <p>
        During my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and while developing
        my ePortfolio, I realize the depth of growth I’ve had in both technical skills as well as professional growth.
        This program has taught me to become more than just a proficient programmer. It has also taught me how to be a
        collaborative developer, a systems thinker, and a security-conscious problem solver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the program, I have worked on a wide variety of projects such as websites and configuring networks
        besides the ones I used as artifacts for my ePortfolio. The major project outside of my artifacts that I believe
        helped bring all of my core computer science principles together was the creation of the Travlr website. This
        website was created for a full stack development class and really helped me understand and showcase both
        front-end and back-end skills that I’ve learned throughout my journey. It uses MongoDB and RESTful APIs,
        session-based authentication, and the full-stack deployment process to create the website. Through this, and the
        creation of the design document, I had ended up engaging in a collaborative environment with my professor
        through version-controlled databases, ensuring that the design document was written in layman terms for
        non-technical users, and how to properly communicate issues with my peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other classes, I experienced simulated team environments where I learned how to balance different roles,
        provide constructive feedback, and adapt to ensure project goals were met. Finally, the last major principle
        that I learned was the security-conscious development mindset. It became a priority in my work as I tended to
        implement cybersecurity principles, the CIA triad, and ensured that I tried to mitigate attack vectors ahead of
        time instead of reacting to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artifacts that I had chosen in my portfolio represented two of my works that I believe showcased my
        strengths the best. The text-based game shows my ability to redesign legacy code from scratch with a focus on
        industry standards and principles. I focused on maintainability, scalability, and security. It includes a fully
        implemented crafting system, user-authentication and saves, as well as database-driven game logic which are tied
        across multiple modular files. And while this artifact showcased my overall growth, the other artifact showcased
        my mathematical reasoning, algorithm design, and 3D visualization. This artifact was a 3D scene created in
        OpenGL using C++. It displays a Japanese-style shrine and dock in a symbolic scene of passing from one realm to
        the next. Initially, it was just the scene hardcoded to display each individual shape. It was not very modular
        and was very inefficient. I designed a SceneNode class to efficiently create and display each shape as children
        of a parent node. As a result, I encapsulated the transformations and scaling needed to add more to the scene
        easier. This was done through ray-casting algorithms being implemented and adding in texture feedback and
        console diagnostics to validate the rays hitting an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, I am able to showcase the full breadth of my skills and talents with these two artifacts alone. In
        conclusion, this ePortfolio is more than a showcase of academic work. It is a journal and a testament to the
        growth and discipline that I’ve learned through this program. I am entering the professional world not only with
        the knowledge of how to succeed, but with experience, confidence, and clarity in my goals. No matter what my
        line of work is, I am equipped with technical and professional skills to contribute meaningfully to any team or
        project.
