            Hello! My name is Franz Gregor Ignacio, a professional with ACE and BSIS Guard certifications and a
            focused career trajectory toward roles such as Security Analyst, Network Engineer, or Red Team Penetration
            Tester. I am deeply committed to the protection and integrity of digital infrastructure, drawing from a
            strong foundation in physical security and a methodical, detail-oriented mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            My career to date includes direct experience in security operations, where I cultivated skills in threat
            assessment, incident response, and situational awareness in high-stakes environments. These capabilities,
            combined with my academic background and technical projects which includes a developed Python-based game
            and a computer graphics visualization built using OpenGL and C++—demonstrate my readiness to navigate and
            contribute to the evolving cybersecurity landscape through industry standard practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to my technical credentials, I have held leadership roles, including serving as the president of
            the Chess Club, which fostered my ability to think strategically and manage complex challenges. Outside of
            professional pursuits, I am an avid gamer and creative writer, actively developing a game that merges
            narrative design, gameplay mechanics, and modular system architecture.
          </p>

          <p>
            This portfolio showcases selected projects that reflect both my technical proficiency and creative
            aspirations. I invite you to explore the work presented here and welcome opportunities for collaboration,
            mentorship, or professional engagement within the cybersecurity field.
          </p>
